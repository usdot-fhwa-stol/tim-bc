	This <strong>Safety Service Patrol (SSP) Benefit-Cost Module</strong> was developed by FHWA to assist local, State, and Federal governments or agencies with assessing the total value of an SSP program. SSP provides short-term traffic control and scene management along interstate highways and controlled-access primary routes, reducing incident duration and promoting the safe movement of people and commerce. SSP programs are effective methods for managing traffic incidents to reduce traffic delays, wasted fuel, emissions, and the incidence of secondary crashes. This tool calculates program costs and benefits, in terms of monetized equivalents of the measures of effectiveness listed above, and provides an overall benefit/cost ratio of the program. The tool can be used to assess an expansion of an existing SSP program, assess the value of creating a new SSP program, or compare alternatives.
