## Background

This open-source project is part of the [CARMA Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO)](https://usdot-carma.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CRMTSMO/overview) effort.
The goal is to raise awareness of the [existing TIM-BC tool](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/software/research/operations/timbc/), and engage with stakeholders to improve the tool.
For more information about the project and the tool, please visit the STOL TIM-BC Confluence space.

## About the TIM-BC Tool

The TIM-BC tool is a web-based software with standardized BC methodologies that can be universally employed in BC analysis of different TIM strategies. 
With its built-in databases and empirical equations, the tool is simple to use and less data-intensive.

Currently the TIM-BC tool includes eight modules, each allowing users to estimate the program costs and benefits for one TIM strategy.
The eight modules are:
- safety service patrol (SSP), 
- driver removal laws (DRL), 
- authority removal laws (ARL), 
- shared quick-clearance goals (SQCG),
- pre-established towing service agreements (PTSA),
- dispatch colocation (DC),
- TIM task forces (TF), and
- Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) training. 

The TIM-BC tool can be used to assess proposed expansion of existing TIM programs, assess the value of creating a new TIM program, or compare alternatives.
