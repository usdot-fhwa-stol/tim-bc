## Background

This open-source project is part of the [CARMA Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO)](https://usdot-carma.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CRMTSMO/overview) effort.
The goal is to raise awareness of the [existing TIM-BC tool](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/software/research/operations/timbc/), and engage with stakeholders to improve the tool.
For more information about the project and the tool, please visit the STOL TIM-BC Confluence space.

## About the TIM-BC Tool

The TIM-BC tool is a web-based software with standardized BC methodologies that can be universally employed in BC analysis of different TIM strategies. 
With its built-in databases and empirical equations, the tool is simple to use and less data-intensive.

Currently the TIM-BC tool includes eight modules, each allowing users to estimate the program costs and benefits for one TIM strategy.
The eight modules are:
- safety service patrol (SSP), 
- driver removal laws (DRL), 
- authority removal laws (ARL), 
- shared quick-clearance goals (SQCG),
- pre-established towing service agreements (PTSA),
- dispatch colocation (DC),
- TIM task forces (TF), and
- Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) training. 

The TIM-BC tool can be used to assess proposed expansion of existing TIM programs, assess the value of creating a new TIM program, or compare alternatives.

## Resources for End-Users

If you are a TIM program manager, a transportation engineer, a policy maker, or anyone who is interested in using the TIM-BC tool to estiamte TIM benefits and costs, you can [download the TIM-BC Tool here](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/software/research/operations/timbc/). 
Follow the installation instructions and the end-user guide to start using the tool.
To learn more about the data and methodologies implemented in the tool, please visit the Benefit and Cost Estimation Methodology section on our Confluence space.
We intive you to provide your feedback on the tool by leaving a comment on our Confluence space, or sending an email to saxton dot lab at dot dot gov.
