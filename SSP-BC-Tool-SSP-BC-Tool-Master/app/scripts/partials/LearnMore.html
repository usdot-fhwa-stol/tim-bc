<p>
	This <strong>Safety Service Patrol (SSP) Benefit-Cost Subtool</strong> was developed by FHWA to assist local, State, and Federal governments or agencies with assessing the total value of an SSP program. SSP programs are effective methods for managing traffic incidents to reduce traffic delays, wasted fuel, emissions, and the incidence of secondary crashes. This tool calculates program costs and benefits, in terms of monetized equivalents of the measures of effectiveness listed above, and provides an overall benefit/cost ratio of the program.
</p>
<p>
	The tool can be used to assess an expansion of an existing SSP program, assess the value of creating a new SSP program, or compare alternatives. Please refer to the User's Guide and Final project report for more details on how to use the tool and methodologies of BC ratio calculation.
