<p>This <strong>Shared Quick-Clearance Goals (SQCG) Benefit-Cost Module</strong> was developed by FHWA to assist local, State, and Federal governments or agencies with assessing the total value of an SQCG program. SQCG programs are effective methods for managing traffic incidents to reduce traffic delays, wasted fuel, emissions, and the incidence of secondary crashes. This tool calculates program costs and benefits, in terms of monetized equivalents of the measures of effectiveness listed above, and provides an overall benefit/cost ratio of the program.</p>
<p>
The tool can be used to assess an expansion of an existing SQCG program, assess the value of creating a new SQCG program, or compare alternatives.<br><br>For more information about the TIM-BC tool, please visit the <a href="https://fhwa-ops.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TIMBC/overview" target="_blank">FHWA TIM-BC Confluence space.</a>
