# Traffic Incident Management Benefit-Cost (TIM-BC) Tool 2.0

For the first time, the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) TIM-BC tool is now made open source! Brought to you by the 
[Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory (STOL)](https://highways.dot.gov/research/laboratories/saxton-transportation-operations-laboratory/saxton-transportation-operations-laboratory-overview), 
Office of Operations Research and Development, FHWA.

**Version 2.0** of FHWA's TIM-BC tool was developed in 2015. As part of the 
[CARMA Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO)](https://usdot-carma.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CRMTSMO/overview) effort,
the source code of **FHWA's TIM-BC Tool 2.0** is made open-source in 2022.
For more information about the project and the tool, please visit the [STOL TIM-BC Confluence space](https://fhwa-ops.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TIMBC/overview).

The FHWA's TIM-BC Tool is a web-based software with standardized BC methodologies that can be universally employed in BC analysis of different TIM strategies. 
With its built-in databases and empirical equations, the tool is simple to use and less data-intensive.

**FHWA's TIM-BC Tool Version 2.0** includes eight modules, each allowing users to estimate the program costs and benefits for one TIM strategy.
The eight modules are:
- Safety service patrol (SSP).
- Driver removal laws (DRL).
- Authority removal laws (ARL).
- Shared quick-clearance goals (SQCG).
- Pre-established towing service agreements (PTSA).
- Dispatch colocation (DC).
- TIM task forces (TF).
- Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2) training. 

The TIM-BC tool can be used to assess proposed expansion of existing TIM programs, assess the value of creating a new TIM program, or compare alternatives.
