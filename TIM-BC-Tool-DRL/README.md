SSP-BC-Tool
===========

SSP-BC Tool - Safety Service Patrol benefit/cost analysis tool to be created and distributed prior to the more expanded TIM-BC Tool. Research and development sponsored by USDOT Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

## Collaborators

You'll need the Node Package Manager(npm) and Yeoman(yo/bower/grunt).
Google for download instructions and documentations.

Important: Create a .bowerrc file and set "directory" to "app/bower_components".

Run the following on you local repository:
``` bash
bower install && npm install
```
That will install dependencies needed to build/compile our app.

## Watchers

Download ZIP(or clone if you can) and run the "index.html" file within the "dist/" directory.
